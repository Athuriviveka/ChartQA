**Summary**

The existing research conducted a comprehensive study on semi-supervised learning methods for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). They explored eight semi-supervised learning methods, including Pi-Model, Pseudolabel, Mean-Teacher, VAT, MixMatch, ReMixMatch, UDA, and FixMatch. The study evaluated these methods on three FER datasets: FER13, RAF-DB, and AffectNet. Their analysis focused on comparing the performance of these methods against fully-supervised training, highlighting the potential of semi-supervised approaches to achieve comparable results with smaller labeled datasets. **The research aimed to reduce the reliance on large annotated datasets for training deep neural networks in FER tasks.**

In our study, we are focusing specifically on the FER2013 dataset and evaluating the temporal ensembling semi-supervised learning method. By conducting experiments on the FER2013 dataset, we aim to provide a detailed analysis of the performance of temporal ensembling compared to other semi-supervised methods. Our research will complement the existing study by extending the analysis to include the FER2013 dataset and by specifically investigating the efficacy of temporal ensembling for FER tasks on this dataset.
